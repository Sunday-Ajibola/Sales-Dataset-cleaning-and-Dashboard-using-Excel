# Sales-Dataset-cleaning-and-Dashboard-using-Excel
This project showcases my ability to clean and prepare a messy real-world dataset using Microsoft Excel. It includes steps such as removing duplicates, trimming extra spaces, correcting inconsistent entries, eliminating blank rows, and validating the cleaned data. Pivot tables were also used to summarize key insights.
